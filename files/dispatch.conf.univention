# This file configures which methods are dispatched to which backends.
# Entries has to follow the form:
# <regular expression to match method name(s)> : <comma separated list of backend name(s)>
#
# Backend names have to match a backend configuraton file basename <backend name>.conf beneath /etc/opsi/backends.
# For every method executed on backend dispatcher the first matching regular expression will be decisive.
#
# Typical configurations:
#    file, opsipxeconfd and dhcpd backend:
#       backend_.*         : file, opsipxeconfd, dhcpd
#       host_.*            : file, opsipxeconfd, dhcpd
#       productOnClient_.* : file, opsipxeconfd
#       configState_.*     : file, opsipxeconfd
#       .*                 : file
#
#    jsonrpc, opsipxeconfd and dhcpd backend:
#       backend_.*         : jsonrpc, opsipxeconfd, dhcpd
#       .*                 : jsonrpc
#
#    ldap as main backend, mysql as hw/sw invent and license management backend, opsipxeconfd and dhcpd backend:
#       backend_.*         : ldap, mysql, opsipxeconfd, dhcpd
#       host_.*            : ldap, opsipxeconfd, dhcpd
#       productOnClient_.* : ldap, opsipxeconfd
#       configState_.*     : ldap, opsipxeconfd
#       license.*          : mysql
#       softwareLicense.*  : mysql
#       audit.*            : mysql
#       .*                 : ldap
